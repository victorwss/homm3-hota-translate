Resolving Town Type Hint constraints is taking an abnormally long time (more than %1 seconds).
This may happen when many contraints are set in a way that there are very few valid town type repartitions.
Please try removing some contraints.

Incompatible constraints: %t1 of zone %2 and %t3 of zone %4 cannot have both similar and different type.

An unexpected error has occured. It is likely to be a programing error.
Please report to hota crew.
Error occured at line %1 of file %2.

Zone %1 has the option ""All towns have same type"", but Town Type Hint violates this option.

Zone %1 makes a reference to neutral town %2 of zone %3, but this town may not always exist.
Due to technical restrictions, random map generator cannot handle this situation properly. As a result, some constraints set in town type hint may not be met.

Zone %1 refers to itself in token ""%2"", which is not allowed.

Neutral town %1 of zone %2 refers to itself in token ""%3"".

Player towns of zone %1 refer to themselves in token ""%2"".
